        to log in, but will not receive any of his normal <span
        class="doc-desc-title">Alerts</span> or have any tickets assigned.

    title: Assigned Group
    content: >
        The <span class="doc-desc-title">Group</span> that you choose for
        this Agent to belong will decide what permissions the Agent has
        within the <span class="doc-desc-title">Help Desk</span>. The
        difference between <span class="doc-desc-title">Teams</span> and
        <span class="doc-desc-title">Groups</span> is that a <span
        class="doc-desc-title">Group</span> decides permissions for its
        Agents, and a <span class="doc-desc-title">Team</span> is simply a
        collection of Agents with a common purpose.
