        Choose a number that controls the priority of the filter being created. The
        lower the number, the higher the priority this filter will have in being
        executed over against another filter that might have an identical match.
        A match is found according to the filter rules set below. If you want this
        filter to be the last filter applied to a match, enable <span
        class="doc-desc-title">Stop Processing Further On Match</span>.

        class="doc-desc-title">Target</span> is the source that created the ticket.
        So, for example, if you choose <span class="doc-desc-opt">Web Forms</span>,

        match any of the rules, and then stop, choose <span
        class="doc-desc-opt">Match Any</span>. If you would like <em><strong>all
        rules</strong></em> of the <span class="doc-desc-title">ticket
        Filter</span> to be matched, choose <span class="doc-desc-opt">Match
