default_email_templates:
    title: Default Email Templates
    content: >
        <span class="doc-desc-title">Templates</span> are used as <span
        class="doc-desc-title">Auto-Responses</span> for various actions that can
        take place during a  Ticket’s lifetime. <span
        class="doc-desc-title">Alerts</span> are sent to Agents as assigned by
        <span class="doc-desc-title">Department</span>, <span
        class="doc-desc-title">Team</span>, <span class="doc-desc-title">Help
        Topic</span> or <span class="doc-desc-title">Group</span>. Responses or
        Replies are intended for the Client who created the Ticket.

default_system_email:
    title: Default System Email
    content: >
        Choose an Email Address from which <span
        class="doc-desc-title">Auto-Responses</span> are sent to Clients. Note,
        however, that if the Department to which a Ticket is assigned sets its own
        Default Email Address, that Department Address will override what is set
        here.

default_alert_email:
    title: Default Alert Email
    content: >
        Choose an Email Address from which Agents are sent <span class="doc-desc-title">Alerts &amp;
        Notices</span>. Note, however, that if the <span
        class="doc-desc-title">Department</span> or <span
        class="doc-desc-title">Help Topic</span> sets its own <span
        class="doc-desc-title">Default Email Address</span>, that <span
        class="doc-desc-title">Department</span> or <span
        class="doc-desc-title">Help Topic</span> setting will override what is set
        here.

admins_email_address:
    title: Admin’s Email Address
    content: >
        Choose an Email Address from which notices of the <span
        class="doc-desc-title">System Error Log</span> and <span
        class="doc-desc-title">New Ticket Alerts</span> (if enabled) are sent to
        the Helpdesk Administrator.

incoming_emails:
    title: Incoming Emails
    content: >
        Allow IMAP/POP polling once you have set up the information in emails
        section of Admin Panel. You can also edit the reply separator text.


email_polling:
    title: Email Polling
    content: >
        Allow IMAP/POP polling once you have set up the information in emails
        section of Admin Panel. You can also edit the reply separator text.

strip_quoted_reply:
    title: Strip Quoted Reply
    content: >
        If enabled, this will remove any preceding correspondences duplicated
        between response communication. Thereby, the Agent &amp; Client, when viewing
        the Ticket, will not see any one preceding message duplicated. <br /><br />
        <strong>Note:</strong> this will not actually delete preceding communication; it will only hide it from
        the Agent &amp; Client. Furthermore, this feature is relationally dependent
        on the <span class="doc-desc-title">Reply Separator Tag</span> below.

reply_separator_tag:
    title: Reply Separator Tag
    content: >
        This is the string that will tell the engine that anything below this line
        is old correspondence. This way the engine knows to remove it from the
        Client or Agent’s sight. <br /><br />
        <strong>Note:</strong> this is only relevant if <span
        class="doc-desc-title">Strip Quoted Reply</span> is enabled above.

emailed_tickets_priority:
    title: Emailed Tickets Priority
    content: >
        Choose whether you would like the priority option of the email service 
        (e.g., Yahoo, Gmail, etc.) to dictate the new ticket’s priority status. This 
        setting can be overridden by a <span class="doc-desc-title">Ticket 
        Filter</span>.

        and <code><strong>CC</strong></code> fields of email as ticket
        collaborators.<br /><br />
         <em>Collaborators can always be added manually by staff members when
        viewing a ticket.</em>

default_outgoing_email:
    title: Default Outgoing Email
    content: >
        <span class="doc-desc-title">Default Outgoing Email</span> only applies to
        outgoing emails without SMTP setting.

enable_autocron_poll:
    title: Poll Email using Auto-cron
    content: >
        <em><b>Not Recommended</b></em><br/><br/>
        Enables fetching email periodically using the automatic cron system.
        As admin and staff members interact with the system, the system will
        periodically run cleanup routines called the auto-cron. This setting
        enables fetching email during this cleanup.
