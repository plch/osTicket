default_email_templates:
    title: Default Email Templates
    content: >
        <span class="doc-desc-title">Templates</span> are used as <span
        class="doc-desc-title">Auto-Responses</span> for various actions that can
        take place during a  Ticket’s lifetime. <span
        class="doc-desc-title">Alerts</span> are sent to Agents as assigned by
        <span class="doc-desc-title">Department</span>, <span
        class="doc-desc-title">Team</span>, <span class="doc-desc-title">Help
        Topic</span> or <span class="doc-desc-title">Group</span>. Responses or
        Replies are intended for the Client who created the Ticket.

default_system_email:
    title: Default System Email
    content: >
        Choose an Email Address from which <span
        class="doc-desc-title">Auto-Responses</span> are sent to Clients. Note,
        however, that if the Department to which a Ticket is assigned sets its own
        Default Email Address, that Department Address will override what is set
        here.

default_alert_email:
    title: Default Alert Email
    content: >
        Choose an Email Address from which <span class="doc-desc-title">Alerts &amp;
        Notices</span> are sent to Agents. Note, however, that if the <span
        class="doc-desc-title">Department</span> or <span
        class="doc-desc-title">Help Topic</span> sets its own <span
        class="doc-desc-title">Default Email Address</span>, that <span
        class="doc-desc-title">Department</span> or <span
        class="doc-desc-title">Help Topic</span> setting will override what is set
        here.

        class="doc-desc-title">System Error Log</span> and <span

strip_quoted_reply:
    title: Strip Quoted Reply
    content: >
        If enabled, this will remove any preceding correspondences duplicated
        between response communication. Thereby, the Agent &amp; Client, when viewing
        the Ticket, will not see any one preceding message duplicated. Note, this
        will not actually delete preceding communication; it will only hide it from
        the Agent &amp; Client.

reply_separator_tag:
    title: Reply Separator Tag
    content: >
        This is the string that will tell the engine that anything below this line
        is old correspondence. This way the engine knows to remove it from the
        Client or Agent’s sight. Note, this is only relevant if <span
        class="doc-desc-title">Strip Quoted Reply</span> is enabled above.

emailed_tickets_priority:

        available which honor the priority flag set in incoming email. If enabled,
        the priority of new tickets will be set by the priority of the email used
        to create them, if available.

    title: Poll Email using Auto-cron
    content: >
        <em><b>Not Recommended</b></em><br/><br/>
        Enables fetching email periodically using the automatic cron system.

        periodically run cleanup routines called the auto-cron. This setting
