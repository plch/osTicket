        If this is your first time creating a new Email Template, simply choose the
        Default Template in the list to clone. Each Template contains a set of
        customized Alerts, Responses, Notices, etc. that are utilized depending on
        the relevant event that triggers them. By cloning Template Sets, you are
        able to create Templates that only differ minimally without having to
        recreate the details they have in common.
