        Templates are used as auto-responses for various actions that can take
        place during a  Ticket’s lifetime. Alerts are sent to Agents as assigned by
        Department, Team, Help Topic or Group. Responses or Replies are intended
        for the customer or user who created the Ticket. You can create your own
        set of Templates for each Department and customize each message. We highly
        suggest you copy the Default Templates to create a new set for editing. To
        do this, click <span class='doc-desc-title'>Add New Template</span>, then
        select the Default Template from the drop-down list next to <span
        class='doc-desc-title'>Template to Clone</span>.
